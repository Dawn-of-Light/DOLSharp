Build Status for NetFramework and NetCore builds: [![Build Status](https://github.com/Dawn-of-Light/DOLSharp/actions/workflows/create_release.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/Dawn-of-Light/DOLSharp/actions/workflows/create_release.yml)

Latest Release : https://github.com/Dawn-of-Light/DOLSharp/releases/latest

How To Build
----

Clone Git Repository to a working Directory.

Restore Nuget Package : https://docs.nuget.org/consume/nuget-faq

This will download dependencies from nuget repository instead of using embedded binaries.

Then Build the project. (use Debug Target if you intend to contribute or write your own scripts...)

The debug folder should be your working directory from now on, you should focus on populating a database to build your server and rely on source files to find constants values used in database records...

You should use an IDE to track default behaviors and reach code parts where constants are used, handling breakpoint with a debugger can be a life savior in understanding how some game rules are enforced with legacy code.
