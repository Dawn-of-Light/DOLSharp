			//4.Block, parry, and bolt attacks are affected by this code, as you know. We made a fix to how the code counts people as "in combat." Before this patch, everyone grouped and on the raid was counted as "in combat." The guy AFK getting Mountain Dew was in combat, the level five guy hovering in the back and hoovering up some exp was in combat  if they were grouped with SOMEONE fighting, they were in combat. This was a bad thing for block, parry, and bolt users, and so we fixed it.  Grab Bag 6/6/03
			//5.Positional degrees - Side Positional combat styles now will work an extra 15 degrees towards the rear of an opponent, and rear position styles work in a 60 degree arc rather than the original 90 degree standard. This change should even out the difficulty between side and rear positional combat styles, which have the same damage bonus. Please note that front positional styles are not affected by this change.  1.62
