 *
 * Description:
 *  Brief Walkthrough: 
 * 1) Travel to loc=41211,50221 Vale of Mularn to speak with Dalikor 
 * 2) Go to Griffin Handler Njiedi, at loc=55561,58225,5005 dir=126 Vale of Mularn, and purchase a griffin ticket to Gotar. 
 * 3) Once in Gotar (You'll be dropped off at the entrance of Ft. Alta.) look for MasterBriedi. He tends to roam in a circular pattern around the front of Ft. Alta, and may take a few clicks to get him to respond to you. I first found him at loc=26240,15706,4489 dir=292 Gotar and moving in the western direction. 
 * 4) Hand MasterBriedi the Scroll for Master Briedi from Dalikor. 
 * 5) /use the Master Briedi's List from Master Briedi 
 * 6) Kill an escaped thrall for his Tattered Shirt. 
 * 7) Kill a Smiera-Gatto for its smiera-gatto claw 
 * 8) Kill a Coastal Wolf for its coastal wolf blood. 
 * 9) Find Master Briedi and hand him the items he asks for that you have collected. 
 * 10) Master Briedi will teleport you back to Dalikor. Talk with Dalikor. 
 * 11) Right click on Master Briedi and then click on Dalikor for further instructions. 
 * 12) Go to loc= 39315,38457 Vale of Mularn, with Master Briedi in tow. When you get there you will see a swarm of Fallen Askefruer Guard's with Princess Aiyr in the middle of the swarm. Focus on killing Princess Aiyr, blue con to a level 4, Master Briedi will deal with the Askefruer Guard's. Once Princess Aiyr is dead (when she dies her head will appear in your inventory) you can help Master Briedi finish killing the other Askefruer. 
 * 13) Speak with Master Briedi after the fight. 
 * 14) Go back to Dalikor and type /whisper returned to Gotar. 
 * 15) Hand Dalikor Princess Aiyr's Head to collect your reward.
