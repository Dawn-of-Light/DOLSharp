 * Description:
 * Do this quest early to get the most out of the cloak, but don't give it away -
 * you might need it again later (hint). 
 *
 * The trip between Ludlow and Humberton is a lot faster if you run over the hill instead 
 * of going around it - just watch out for boulderlings.
 * 
 * Talk to Steward Willie to receieve this quest. The objective it fairly simple, leave
 * the village and hunt down a wolf pup. You'll find them right outside near the road to Camelot. 
 *
 * Although you can get the quest at level 1, the wolf will be yellow to you until level 2.
 * Take a friend along or hunt around Humberton a bit before trying the pup. 
 *
 * After killing the wolf, take the pelt back to Steward Willie, and you'll receive a Wolf Head Token.
 * Take this over the hill to Seamstress Lynnet in Ludlow, and she'll make you the Wolf Pelt Cloak.
