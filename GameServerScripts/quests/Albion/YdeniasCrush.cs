 *  Brief Walkthrough: 
 * 1) Travel to loc=10813,27525 Camelot Hills (Cotswold Village) to speak with Ydenia Philpott and get his letter
 * 2) Go to loc=25414,47426 Prydwen Keep and give the letter to Elvar Tambor 
 * 3) Take Elvar's letter back to Ydenia in Cotswold Village.  She is in the tavern there. 
 * 4) Deliver the letter to Ydenia and ask her for your reward (/whisper something).
