Housing is still incomplete.
Whats currently working is
*) lots cost 95p->300g now... they get 1.2p cheaper every hour
*) limitation to one house per player
*) lot markers sell items now
*) spawning houses
*) entering houses (with correct pos for all models now)
*) leaving houses (only a work-a-round at the moment)
*) porch! (and porch remove)
